# Data-Analytics-project-

This Project aims to study factors that impact life expectancy in developing and developed countries. The project aims to discover if each variable impacts developing and developed countires differently for example, does an increase in population impact life expectancy differently in developed countries that it would in a developing country?

For this study, the following variable were used in the dataset:

Status: Developing or developed country
Life Expectancy: life expectancy in age
Adult Mortality: Rates of both sexes (probability of dying between 15 and 60 years per 1000 population)
Infant Deaths: Number of Infant Deaths per 1000 population
Alcohol: Alcohol, recorded per capita (15+) consumption (in litres of pure alcohol)
Percentage Expenditure: Expenditure on health as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product per capita(%)
Hepatitis: immunisation coverage among 1-year-olds (%)
Measles: number of reported cases per 1000 population
BMI: Average Body Mass Index of entire population
Under Five Deaths: Number of under-five deaths per 1000 population
Polio:Polio (Pol3) immunisation coverage among 1-year-olds (%)
Total Expenditure: General government expenditure on health as a percentage of total government expenditure (%)
diphtheria: Diphtheria tetanus toxoid and pertussis (DTP3) immunization coverage among 1-year-olds (%)
HIV_AIDS: Deaths per 1 000 live births HIV/AIDS (0-4 years)
GDP: Gross Domestic Product per capita (in USD)
Population: Population of the country
Thinness_1_to_19year: Prevalence of thinness among children and adolescents for Age 10 to 19 (% )
Thinness_5_to_9years: Prevalence of thinness among children for Age 5 to 9(%)
Income composition of resources: Human Development Index in terms of income composition of resources (index ranging from 0 to 1)
Schooling: Number of years of Schooling(years)


Method:

Excel,SQL AND Power BI was used to analyse the dataset


Key Discoveries:

The trend of life expectancy, schooling, income composition, BMI has increased overtime, while alcohol intake has fallen in both groups.

Increase in population affects life expectancy negatively in developing countries and has a positive correlation in developed countries.

Higher GDP per capita correlates with a higher life expectancy in both groups.

Expenditure on health that is deemed above or at required standard correlates with a higher average life expectancy in developing countries. But in developed nations, avg LE only improves when expenditure on health is above 7% of GDP.
